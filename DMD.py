# We are using the DLP Lightcrafter 4500
# which does not support uploading patterns to onboard flash on the fly
# instead, you can upload a new firmware with images via USB 1.0
# which isn't great.
# Since I don't need to switch between patterns super fast, I will
# just use the Lightcrafter's video input to display patterns.
 
# Open a borderless window on the DMD and use video display
